I attended RubyConf 2022 in Huston Texas this fall.  There were a number of great talks.

Once the talks are public folks might want to view the Happy Queues talk by Daniel Magliola.

I have put some captures of slides to the talks I attended [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JK1PFRnPuMZJ8HHqjTZhWoCVlrEmJr--)
