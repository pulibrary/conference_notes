#### New and upcoming features

* New feature: on-demand speech mode, it only speaks when commanded (helpful for testers and low vision users)
* There is an add-on store for NVDA, they have improved it
* New Braille tables for Thai, Filipino, and Romanian
* Incorporated feedback from CSUN 2023:
  * Donor badge, if you have donated to NVDA
  * WASAPI audio responsiveness improvements
* Keeping bluetooth audio devices awake, so they don't shut off when it is done speaking

#### Roadmap

* Better braille support
* Migrating from 32-bit to 64-bit (not expecting performance improvements, just keeping up)
* [Mathcat integration](https://nsoiffer.github.io/MathCAT/)
* Exploring AI image description.  There are already 3 plugins that do this, but they need to make sure that:
  * it is private (preferably running on the local device)
  * it is low-cost
  * it is performant
  * it supports global languages (English and Brazilian Portuguese are the most common languages for NVDA, they don't want to build something that only works in English)
  * it is accurate


#### Documentation and support

* They updated various guides.  Their guide for using Office with NVDA turned up bugs in Microsoft Office, which Microsoft was able to then fix.
* They also have phone support!
* NVDA certified expert exam.  Anyone can take the exam for free, and optionally pay $70 for the credential.  It is very advanced!

#### Questions

* Multi-line braille display -- there are very exciting new devices.  It has never been supported by screen readers before, so there will be UX questions coming up.
