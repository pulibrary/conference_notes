* Very great keynote!
* Opening up communication to include more people can take some time, and it can be unexpected, but ultimately it makes it better for everyone
* She shared a story of going to a bar with a keyboard braille display -- it ended up that her classmates really appreciated communicating via keyboard and braille display, because they don't have to shout over the loud music
* Designing for the Deaf community, or for disabled communities can end up helping lots of other people too (email, gestural touch based interaction)
* Connection between assistive technology and right-to-repair legislation: when people finally find some technology that works for them and their body, and it breaks, it is hard to get it repaired, and the new version might not work as well for them
* "My disability did not prevent me from doing the jobs, it was Ableism and employment discrimination"
* Disabilities are opportunities for innovation
* "Sometimes when people are working on tech, there is a desire to simplify the disability community.  TO flatten us to one dimensnion.  THere is a desire to downplay the different sign languages around the world"
* [Protactile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protactile): a language centering touch-base communication
* Example of Lewis and Clark: they said "we haven't worked with braille displays before, but we're willing to put in the work"
* There is the idea that non-disabled people are independent.  That is not true.  "Many of you like drinking coffee, but few of you grow your own coffee beans."
* The difference between accommodations for sighted people and for blind people is Ableism.  Lights, slides, microphones, chairs -- these are all accommodations for sighted people, hearing people, walking people that take money
* There are many barriers we dismiss as small, we think "there are worse things in the world".  But advocating for the small things is how we learn to advocate for the big things.
* Add descriptive transcripts to videos!
