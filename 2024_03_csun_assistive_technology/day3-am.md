* [Non-linear font scaling](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/features#non-linear-font-scaling): the small text gets bigger by 200%, the big headers get only slightly bigger, so that you don't have to scroll and scroll past humungous letters
* Notifications via camera flash -- this was a feature that people advocated for at accessibility conferences, which helped the accessibility teams to prioritize it
* Live captions and live transcribe: they have added language
