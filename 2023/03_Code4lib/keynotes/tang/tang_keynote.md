### Lydia Tang Keynote

 * hard to explain to someone that they are welcome when they encounter obstacles
 * we all have expertise to share
 * Instead of back to normal, how can we reimagine a more accessible future
 * Notice how disabled people describe themselves and use their language
 * Join communities of practice and listen! 
 * do not put the burden of advocating for accessibility only on disabled people
 * do one more accessible thing today
