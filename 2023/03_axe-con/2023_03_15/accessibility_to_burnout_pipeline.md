conference recommendation: https://conf.a11yto.com/

Why are accessibility specialists in tech at higher risk of burnout?

* lack of control
    * management issue
    * managers not informed about accessibility, don't understand why it is important
* sense of futility
    * overwhelming tech debt, keeps building up, and new accessibility issues being added
    * accessibility specialists afraid of taking time off because a decision will be made while they are away that will fail users
* unreasonable and ever changing workload
    * time lost to context-switching
* having to fight for a seat at the table
    * having to always advocate for your role and that accessibility is important
    * people whose jobs include advocacy on top of their own job have high burnout rates
    * especially impactful on accessibility specialists with disabilities!
