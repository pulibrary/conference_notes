# Trust is the true measure of inclusion: change my mind

Presented by Elle Waters

"We're in the gap business.  While we strive for a fully inclusive design process, almost everything that we do today is about identifying and resolving access gaps."

We need to build trust by:
* fixing the gaps, but also:
* acknowledging the wide chasm of inequity
* considering the full context in which a user with disabilities encounter your app
* co-designing with people with disabilities, especially by having people with disabilities represented on your team. First, make sure that the software your team uses is accessible, so they can do their job!
* include accessibility work in release notes, and add a feedback mechanism
* provide accessibility help documentation
