Like all EU member states, Ireland has taken the necessary measures to make their websites and mobile applications more accessible. NDA has built a program where hundreds of government websites are monitored on a weekly basis. The results are shared and a supporting program has been built. This leads to impressive results: organizations manage to improve the accessibility of their websites significantly in a relatively short period of time. The aggregated results are included in the official reporting to the European Commission.

* NDA's approach:

  * Market research - discovering key players and their offerings (deque, interaccess, abilitynet)
  * Public procurement

  * 54 in-depth 
  * 
  * 
* Make sense of the data: Scores of Local Authorities

* The impact - positives
  * Significant increase in awareness by Public Bodies in Ireland

  * Monitoring shock
  * NDA building relationships

  * No clear methodology for reporting compliance to the European Commission

* Where to now?
  * Digital First = Accessibility First
* Greater engagement by NDA with public bodies to:
  * improve compliance with EN 301 549
  * continue to support awareness and capacity
  * support accessibility maturity
  * improve feedback and compalints mechanism
* work in partnership with Deque to further develop methodology for EU WAD monitoring
* Positive feedback from EC on reporting approach

Lessons learned - advice to goverment bodies
* start now!
* Define key performance indicators/ scorecards, set organizational goals
* prioritize
* Take small incremental setps in your efforts
* Monitor high level and continously , use automatic testing tools

* Work closely with your accessibility partner and your web agency/vendor to address this

* Beyond Compliance
  * compliance with minimum accessibility standard
    * Plain English
    * Irish Sign language
