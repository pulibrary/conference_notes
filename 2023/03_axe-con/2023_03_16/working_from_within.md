A panel of digital accessibility professionals, all of whom have a disability, will discuss how their personal experiences with disability, inclusion, and accessibility guide and inform their professional lives.

Panelists:
* Justin Yarbrough
* Steve Lowe
* Trudy Harrington Karl

* What attracted you to working in a11y?
  * By accident. Started working at the community college. Help them out with screen readers. 
  * During a job in a consulting firm. 1st national database of assistive technology.
  *  Abledata project
  * Connecting the dots: having dissabilities and having purpose.
  * Heard a talk by Derek Featherstone
* Does havin a dissability helped you to relate to the people you're working with?
  * Trying not to make assumptions for people.  
  * Helps to ignite excitement/passion in others
  * You don't need to have a disability to have a passion for accessibility.
  * It helps to have been in their shoes (example: to have been that person who can't get past a screen because a button was set up badly)
  * Appreciate accessibility for the web because of my experience with other people. 
    * AbleData was originally mainly a phone-based service.
    * Got to speak with people on the phone that also have problems.
    * I had that empathy and knew just from my experience how important it was to be patient and not to try to rush them with respect. 

* How was disability shaped your professional experience before and beyond your current career in digital accessibility?
  *  started out by demonstrating an accessibility bug on a screen reader so that the college's vendor could fix it -- a year later, the college offered him a job doing screen reader testing 
  *  I've translated dissabilities as a gift.  

* What does inclusion look like where you work?
  * "Simply respecting the talent and the ability of everyone in the workplace"

* Separating work from life
  * "as a disabled person, it is hard to define where work stops, because I live and breathe disability and accessibility issues"
  * important to draw that line somehow
