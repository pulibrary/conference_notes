## The Secret Mechanisms of CSS by Josh Comeau

### Flow Layout
* Analogy
* Constrained horizontal space, unlimited vertical space
* The layout is built within blocks
* Images are considered inline elements
* `inline-block` sits like an inline element. Creates a rectangle
* `inline` line-wrap . will not create a rectangle

### Flexbox layout
* Items are distributed across the primary and secondary axis

### Positioned Layout
[Resources Josh Comeau](joshwcomeau.com/smashing)
* Elements are anchored to something other than its calculated layout.
* position
   * absolute - child items look for nearest parent element with 
   * relative
   * fixed - elements anchor to the viewport
* z-index
   * works in combination with position
   * implemented in some not all layouts
   * positioned elements will be promoted above non-positioned elements
   * z-index compares values within the same stacking context

* Rule-based
* Predictive
   * e.g. autocomplete on your phone
* Deep Learning
   * GPT model is based on: [Attention is All you need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)  

### Problems with GenAI
* Knowledge Cutoff
* Hallucinations
* Finite Context Length
* It's not human

### RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation
* Components of RAG
  * Data
  * Embedding Models
  * Vector Store
  * "The AI doesn't matter. What matters more is the UX and the frontend."

### Generative UI
* [Movies++ research project powered by DataStax](https://github.com/datastax/movies_plus_plus), uses semantic search.
* UI itself is dependent on inputs either by users or application developers beforehand.

## Bridge the Gap between Design and Development, One Token at a Time by Samantha Gordashko
* [More resources - Samantha's website](bento.me/samiam)
* Design token
   * Expresses a design decision
   * Design Tokens Community Group
   * Name, Value, Type, Description. 
* [tokens-studio-for-figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/tokens-studio-for-figma)
* Consider Devs as users.
* Lack of knowledge on both sides contributes to the GAP
* Accountability for your role on the team.
* Be willing to learn and have empathy
* Documentation + Cross functional communication
* Collaborate with the engineering team
* Iterate back on what we have worked on.

### Design Tokens Tools
