## History of accessibility at Google

* Originally, each product team was responsible for each product's accessibility.  Which led to a lot of accessibility errors and regressions.
* She proposed: allow broken accessibility to block a product launch, but all the teams were too decentralized for this to work
* Eventually, settled on a hub-and-spoke model.  They are the hub, providing all the resources.


## What they do

* They added a hands-on accessibility component to the new software developer orientation.  They are given a system with accessibility errors, and they have to fix it as part of orientation. This seems like something we could do with our student developers as part of their onboarding!
* They started adding accessibility into the design phase, including adding automated linting checks to their designs.  I'm curious about learning more about that.
* Trusted tester program: launched in 2017.  Several hundred participants with various disabilities, who get early access to google products and features.  Their team is able to get really valuable feedback on a regular basis this way.
* Google play store now gives warnings when a developer tries to upload an app with accessibility errors.
* Making the Google workplace more accessible: training recruiters and interviewers.  Training managers.  Looking at the built environment.  For two reasons: it's the right thing to do.  But also it leads to better products.
* They made sure each product has a VP who holds the product responsible for accessibility.
