GitHub is empowering people with disabilities to create, collaborate and contribute to the development of both mainstream and access technologies. Join Ed Summers, Head of Accessibility at GitHub, for a celebration of disabled developers and a peak at some of the technology that empowers them to do their best work.

Presented by: Ed Summers

## My perspective on accessibility
* Establishing accountability

* Discovering principles for yourself can help in the inevitable conflicts that come up, so he is sharing his principles
  * What is disability - . Disability results in the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal or environmental barriers that Hinders they're full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with with others. -- UN's convention on the rights of persons with disabilities
  * Principle 1: Everyone deserves the opportunity to participate
    * It's easy to get caught up in the technical or administrative aspects, and lose sight of the "participate" and that we are talking about real people
  * Principle 2: Disabilities are not inherent to people.
    * Disabilities arise when they try to do sth and they encounter barriers. 
  * Principle 3: We all have the power to prevent disabilities. We remove barriers. Environmental and technical
    * attitudinal barriers: it is very hard to change people's minds
    * The accessibility equation: impairments x barriers = disabilities
    * If there are zero barriers, there are no disabilities
  * Principle 4: Technology is a disruptive force for inclusion and exclusion
  * Principle 5: Progress trumps perfection:

  

## Github and acessibility
* What can you build on Github?
  * A community
  * A solution to a problem



* Github accessibility prime directive: empower people with disabilities to build cool technologies

* Pillars
  * Our workplace
  * Our offerings
  * Our impact 
  * Our promise

## Github Copilot AI pair program
* Suggests code for you to consider
* Increases developer happiness and productivity
* Never gets tired or passes judgement
* Increases developers productivity
* Example of a developer with cerebral palsy: they can type really abbreviated instructions to co-pilot, and it will write all the boilerplate, minimizing physical impacts
