* Exclusionary culture around accessibility - encountered wehn trying to motivate people to be more accessible
* "When we talk about accessibility, we have to come from the understanding that disabled people, societally we are never meant to live a public life. Anytime we call for accessibility, for inclusion, it is seen as an extra, unnecessary, too expensive, special treatment."

* To motivate people to be accessible is to motivate people to be whimsy.
* Nobody is having something taken from them by accessibility -- it's providing more options!
* Lack of accessibility (especially in work culture and academia) weeds out people with disabilities from conversations that they need to be in!
* We we use a lack of accessibility to 
  * keep disabled people from engaging in spaces where we don't want disabled people. 
  * We have to understand that while we want more accessibility, while we want these things to expand, it is very often used as a weapon and a toolkit to
    * keep disabled people out,  
    * keep disabled people from conversations that we should be a part of.
* Language of "merit".  A "merit-based space" is designed to weed out disabled people, keep disabled people out of important conversations in that space

* Accessibility is about abundance: let's talk about it with joy!
  * It is also the law. It was passed 33 years ago. It's not a "gift", it's required!

  * People definitely face reprecussions for requesting these
  * internalized ableism
  * "somebody else needs the accommodation more than me"
* When people are fearful of talking about accessibility, using distancing language
  * internalized ableism around the words accessibility or disability
  * using words like "What tools do you think would be helpful in this instance"
  * sometimes using the word "disability" is required
* Is it legally challenging to recruit people with disability for a research?
  * As a research resource subject.  
  * Make sure you are transparent.  
  * Health insurance during this research? This is the first thing people will think.
