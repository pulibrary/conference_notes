### Red, Blue, and Purple AI by Jason Haddix

interesting ai bots mentioned
* spear phishing -- given the name of an individual, it will write an email that is super convincing to them (security experts say "yeah, I probably would have clicked on that").  Very scary!
* XSS filter bypass -- when you think you have fixed an XSS vuln, it will give you some other curls to try to verify that you _actually_ fixed it
* during incidents, help give you checklists of things to check so you don't forget during the stress
* create wireshark filters to find what you actually want
* creating new DAST and SAST rules (like a semgrep rule)
* stridegpt: it does threat modeling for your application
