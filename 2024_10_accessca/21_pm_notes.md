#### Accessible Archives: Why we don’t have them and why AI isn’t helping

**Mark Pellegrino**

* pdf is a well formed document that captures everything within a container
* AI can be used in ALT text and OCR but has to be outsourced
* Recognition of training not being nearly good enough
* tesseract-OCR with training data and uses a command line tool
  * many organizations share their trained datasets
* Internet Archive and others are building tools to edit the OCR images
* Work with the individual student instead of trying to reach a universal standard

#### Can Vivo and Primo play nice? Integrating researcher profiles in the catalogue

**Matthew Fesnak**

* work done without authority control from metadata specialist
  * cleaned up ISBNs by using ALMA
  * Manual and painful process
  * Use 856 to Experts. Useful if you use SubField 3
